# C++ playground

## Purpose of the repository

I'm just learning C++ and playing with it.

## What I have done

- Pushing value to the end of array (arr_functions.cpp)
- Replacing all `%` in string with some values (string_format.cpp)
- Playing a little with classes
- Compiling by bash script
- Compiling many files
